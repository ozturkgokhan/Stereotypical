# Stereotypical JS
Stereotypical programming exercises for **JavaScript, NodeJS** and **JS Testing frameworks and libraries** . 

I tought it would be a better choice to seperate those non-valuable projects from the open source community to show they are just for practice purposes. On the otherhand they are still available to be ***contributed*** or ***forked*** if anyone wants to.
